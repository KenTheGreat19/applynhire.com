This directory contains legacy JavaScript files that were moved from the project root when the front-end was reorganized.

They are kept for reference and backward compatibility only. The canonical scripts are in `/site/js/`.

If you need to restore an old script temporarily, copy it from here into `/site/js/` and update page references.
